=Mark down template=

To make the markdown file in order to convert it to a great pdf file you need the following
1. Create a file with .md extention
2. In the file make the initial heater as below
{{{yaml
---
title: "Sales Benefit"
author:
  - Mohammed Salah Albatati
  - Huda Albatati
date: 12 Mar 21
header: This is nice
footer: so nice
numbersections: true
---
  }}}
3. Full in your document as you want but use the other type of markdown shortcuts

_Note: I did not find a way to add the footers on each page yet_

4. Use the command to convert to pdf

{{{bash
pandoc file.md -o file.pdf
}}}

----
Notes:
- I've made the binding for space pc to compile to pdf and save it to /usr/tem/
- Space pp to open the pdf file 
* To add images to the pdf and resize it use the below code
