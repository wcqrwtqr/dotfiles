===Using OS library to get the current directory path===
* This is a preferred method to make the python code can work at any place if you changed the folder location 
* This is always the best method to get the make top folder path
* The code is as follows:

{{{python 
import os
package_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
#now you can use the package_dir to select any file in the directory
source_file1 = os.path.join(package_dir,'file2.csv')
source_file2 = os.path.join(package_dir,'file2.csv')
}}}
